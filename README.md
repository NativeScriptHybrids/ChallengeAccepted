# Challenge Accepted
A mobile app for doing and sharing real life challenges, written in native script

### The Idea
Get a random challenge and decide wether to take or skip it. If you skip it, you get another one, otherwise, you have a certain amount of time (given in the challenge description) 
to do the challenge. Once done, post your proof - picture or video, and let the others decide if they like your way or not. The more likes you gather, the higher you are in the charts!

Other features include creating and posting your own challenges and winning badges, depending on results.
